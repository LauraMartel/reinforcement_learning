# Data analysis
- The project: reinforcement_learning
- Description: Generative Dungeon Maps
- Data Source: Imki
- Type of analysis: q-learning algorithm

Your repository should contain a readme including:
- The steps to deploy and reproduce your results:
    To read the file: python filename.py
    To have as an executable: pyinstaller RL_pygame_class.py --onefile --noconsole

- Your architecture’s presentation:
    I wrote a class modified from the [code] (https://becominghuman.ai/q-learning-a-maneuver-of-mazes-885137e957e4) and [github](https://github.com/bvpsk/Reinforcement-learning/blob/master/Q-Learning/git_simple_game.py).
    There is a starting point, a treasure point and an exit. Four walls are also added.


- All the information that need to be mentioned:
    I used vs code to write the code in python with a virtual ubuntu environment.
    Each line is commented in the main document.

- BONUS: discuss an evaluation metric to assess the difficulty of the maze (it doesn’t
need to be implemented). we can use evaluation metrics such as
